This photograph by a student of Clarence H. White shows how the term lace can migrate to materials that are defined above all by their stiffness. Before taking on photography, Latimer worked as an engineer in the Taylor-Wharton Iron & Steel Company and retained a long-term interest in suspended bridges. Here lace is defined by the pattern the steel cables form by intersecting on the open sky. It returns to the definition of lace as a material in which the pattern is surrounded by air, with bars of net holding the various elements of the pattern together. Here, soft material -- linen, cotton, or silk -- is replaced by iron and steel, opening the many possibilities we can think of for lace in architecture and design.
