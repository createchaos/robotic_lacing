By the end of the 18th century, several inventors have tried to design machines capable of producing lace. One of them, John Heathcoat, is shown on this Japanese woodblock print part of the series "Lives of Great People of the Occident" bringing his wife the first successful result from his knitting machine. A product until then exclusively made by female labor, lace is here created by male entrepreneurs. Heathcoat will end up establishing a lucrative lacemaking factory in Tiverton, Devon, after his first establishment was destroyed by the Luddites, a secret association of textile workers fighting against mechanization. This story highlights the tensions existing in the lacemaking industry between skilled craftsmen and manufacturers. Machine-made lace would never entirely replace hand-made lace but would significantly reduce the number of traditional lacemakers, depriving many craftswomen of a source of important income.
