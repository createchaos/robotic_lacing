Signed and dated in Venice 1888, this drawing by the French-born American artist and historian August Jaccaci figures a series of portraits of female needle lacemakers and is probably set in the island of Burano, in the lagune. Burano used to be one of the main centers of the creation of the finest and most sought-after lace in the early modern period until the craft almost died in the beginning of the 19th century. In 1872, following a severe winter for the fishing industry, a group of noble Italian women led by countess Adriana Marcello and queen Margherita of Savoy, established a school aimed at reviving the art of needle lacemaking and providing an income for the islanders. The drawing probably shows one of the first cohorts of women trained in the art. The school and its museum, the Burano Museo del Merletto, are still active today, even if the harship and labor required to create hand-made lace fail to attract a younger generation of islanders who now mostly live out of the tourist industry.
