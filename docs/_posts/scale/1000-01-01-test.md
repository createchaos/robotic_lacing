Machine-made lace was not only incomparatively cheaper than hand-made lace, allowing large segments of the population to acquire it, but also easier and faster to produce on scales rarely seen before. New usages were adopted, like the one seen on this glass plate negative by the pictorialist photographer Clarence H. White. In this typical American bourgeois interior of the turn of the 20th century, lace curtains take center stage. The transparency of the fabric allows light to penetrate the dark interior while the lace grid evokes the geometric cut glass of the window and the floral motives play with the outside vegetation. From a commodity reserved to the financial elite, be it secular or religious, lace has become by the 20th century synonymous with the bourgeois and working classes interiors.
