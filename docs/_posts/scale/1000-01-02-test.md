This exquisite example of Italian needle lace is one of the oldest in the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. This geometric cutwork is characteristic of the free-flowing patterns made in late-16th century Italy called _punto-in-aria_. Here the link with the woven ground has been broken and lace turns from trimming or means of surface decoration into a fabric in its own right. This border made of fine linen with a rose pattern shows a grid of needle-woven and overcast bars, the solid areas worked in pairs of knotted buttonhole stitches and elaborated with buttonholed bars and picots. The extraordinary complexity of the technique can only be appreciated upclose and was produced in small scale.
