This magnificent portrait of an anonymous female member of the financial elite of the Low Countries displays preeminent uses of lace in 17th-century European fashion. Made of fabric, probably linen here, lace needs either a support on which to rest or an additive to acquire the stiffness it naturally lacks. The white lace cuffs contrast with the somptuous black dress on which they rest. Their geometric design of fine cutwork with points of detached needle lace follows examples of contemporary pattern books where lace appears in negative as black ink on the white page. As for the neck ruff,  it stands in the air, either maintained by wire or pasteboard, or heavily starched.
