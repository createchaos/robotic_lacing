<p>We develop a collaborative robotic fabrication process for constructing largely deforming elastic network structures inspired by traditional bobbin lace. 
We leverage both sensing and predictive modeling to inform our tool paths â€” however, our implementation of these methods is greatly simplified by the use of a repeated module known as an \textit{interlaced bigon}, as well as an assumedly large elastic range of the material. To achieve geometric variation in the network, we intentionally deform the material to fit an idealized instance of this module during fabrication. The structure is then passed along by the robots and assembly of subsequent modules continues. When each module is released, the structure relaxes into its natural state. Per bobbin lacing topological rule, the order and manner in which the strands are worked lead to even more formal possibilities.
Our approach demonstrates how this unique construction logic and its ensuing geometry, coupled with limited predictive numerical modeling and a simple computer vision system allows for the bottom-up fabrication of highly complex, tunable elastic networks for which the final shape and scale may not be known.</p>
