			<p class="intro">The use of lace in fashion is linked to the physical manipulation of the fiber material, which upon creation takes the form of its base, into something that can describe volumes distinct from the body. For example, a collar can be made stiff by starching and a ruff can become voluminous by ruching. While the former involves the addition of an external material, the latter speaks to the ability of a material to propel itself into the third dimension by the manipulation of its geometry. Painting lace objects, especially those made stiff by these processes, have been a stimulating challenge for painters, who could showcase their virtuosity in indicating both dramatic shortening and complex effects of transparency. The study of elasticity, which spans several centuries, reveals that a stiff material with a slender cross section will buckle out of plane as it seeks a minimal energy state. In engineering, such large deformations were studied in order to be prevented as they typically indicate structural failure. More recently there has been an abundance of interest in eliciting large elastic deformations for a wide range of applications in scales ranging from the nano to the architectural. Applied to lace, we consider the effects of working with inherently stiff yet pliant, elastic ribbons as opposed to formless round threads and witness the 3D forms that emerge.</p>

						<p>In modern times, hand-made lace remained both a product of luxury and a sign of restraint and modesty. These last qualities were expressed by the material itself, threads of linen or cotton, and by the color, white, a symbol of purity. Members of the New England upper class, like Elizabeth Allen Marquand, wife of one of the founders of The Metropolitan Museum of Art and mother of its first director, aimed to present themselves as the moral descendants of the Puritan settlers. But hand-made lace was also a luxury item: the labor and skill that went into its creation transformed the cheap raw material into one of the most expensive items of a lady’s wardrobe.</p>

						<p>Signed and dated in Venice 1888, this drawing by the French-born American artist and historian August Jaccaci represents a series of female needle lacemakers and is probably set in the island of Burano, in the laguna. Burano was one of the main centers for the creation of the finest and most sought-after lace in the early modern period, until the beginning of the 19th century when the craft almost died out. In 1872, following a severe winter impacting the fishing industry, a group of noble Italian women, led by countess Adriana Marcello and queen Margherita of Savoy, established a school aimed at reviving the art of needle lacemaking and providing an income for the islanders. The drawing probably shows one of the school’s first cohorts of women trained in the art. The school and its museum, the Burano Museo del Merletto, are still active today, even if the hardship and labor required to create hand-made lace generally fail to attract a younger generation of islanders who now mostly live from the tourist industry.</p>

						<p>By the end of the 18th century, several inventors had tried to design machines capable of producing lace. One of them, John Heathcoat, is shown on this Japanese woodblock print.  Part of the series “Lives of Great People of the Occident,” it represents Heathcoat offering his wife the first successful result from his knitting machine. A product that was until then exclusively made by female labor, is here manufactured by male entrepreneurs. Heathcoat would end up establishing a lucrative lacemaking factory in Tiverton, Devon, after his first establishment was destroyed by the Luddites, a secret association of textile workers fighting against mechanization. This story highlights the tensions in the lacemaking industry between skilled craftsmen and manufacturers. Machine-made lace would never entirely replace hand-made lace, but would significantly reduce the number of traditional lacemakers, depriving many craftswomen of a source of important income.</p>
