			<p class="intro">The development of machine lace extended the use of lace in areas previously not systematically explored because of their scale. Examples include curtains and wall decorations, where the size of the strands remained the same but the area that the textile can cover was greatly expanded. They remain however confined to private, interior and domestic uses because of their inherent fragility. Scaling up and expanding the range of materials used to design lacing patterns can open to applications in the public and urban spaces. When prototyping robotics processes we often begin with a scale that fits the constraints of the available tools. To study robotically fabricated lace, we have dramatically increased the scale of the individual strand, as well as the spaces between the strands. Once again, this can change the way we interact with and experience a lace object, moving from the realm of surface into the interstitial.</p>

						<p>In modern times, hand-made lace remained both a product of luxury and a sign of restraint and modesty. These last qualities were expressed by the material itself, threads of linen or cotton, and by the color, white, a symbol of purity. Members of the New England upper class, like Elizabeth Allen Marquand, wife of one of the founders of The Metropolitan Museum of Art and mother of its first director, aimed to present themselves as the moral descendants of the Puritan settlers. But hand-made lace was also a luxury item: the labor and skill that went into its creation transformed the cheap raw material into one of the most expensive items of a lady’s wardrobe.</p>

						<p>Signed and dated in Venice 1888, this drawing by the French-born American artist and historian August Jaccaci represents a series of female needle lacemakers and is probably set in the island of Burano, in the laguna. Burano was one of the main centers for the creation of the finest and most sought-after lace in the early modern period, until the beginning of the 19th century when the craft almost died out. In 1872, following a severe winter impacting the fishing industry, a group of noble Italian women, led by countess Adriana Marcello and queen Margherita of Savoy, established a school aimed at reviving the art of needle lacemaking and providing an income for the islanders. The drawing probably shows one of the school’s first cohorts of women trained in the art. The school and its museum, the Burano Museo del Merletto, are still active today, even if the hardship and labor required to create hand-made lace generally fail to attract a younger generation of islanders who now mostly live from the tourist industry.</p>

						<p>By the end of the 18th century, several inventors had tried to design machines capable of producing lace. One of them, John Heathcoat, is shown on this Japanese woodblock print.  Part of the series “Lives of Great People of the Occident,” it represents Heathcoat offering his wife the first successful result from his knitting machine. A product that was until then exclusively made by female labor, is here manufactured by male entrepreneurs. Heathcoat would end up establishing a lucrative lacemaking factory in Tiverton, Devon, after his first establishment was destroyed by the Luddites, a secret association of textile workers fighting against mechanization. This story highlights the tensions in the lacemaking industry between skilled craftsmen and manufacturers. Machine-made lace would never entirely replace hand-made lace, but would significantly reduce the number of traditional lacemakers, depriving many craftswomen of a source of important income.</p>
