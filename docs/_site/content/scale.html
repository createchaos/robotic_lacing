			<p class="intro">The development of machine lace extended the use of lace in areas previously not systematically explored because of their scale. Examples include curtains and wall decorations, where the size of the strands remained the same but the area that the textile can cover was greatly expanded. They remain however confined to private, interior and domestic uses because of their inherent fragility. Scaling up and expanding the range of materials used to design lacing patterns can open to applications in the public and urban spaces. When prototyping robotics processes we often begin with a scale that fits the constraints of the available tools. To study robotically fabricated lace, we have dramatically increased the scale of the individual strand, as well as the spaces between the strands. Once again, this can change the way we interact with and experience a lace object, moving from the realm of surface into the interstitial.</p>

						<p>This magnificent portrait of an anonymous female member of the financial elite of the Low Countries displays the characteristic and important use of lace in 17th-century European fashion. Made of fabric – here, probably linen – lace needs either a support on which to rest or an additive to give it the stiffness that it inherently lacks. The white lace cuffs contrast with the sumptuous black dress on which they rest. Their geometric design of fine cutwork with points of detached needle lace follows examples of contemporary pattern books, in which lace appears in negative as black ink on the white page. As for the neck ruff, it is free-standing, held either by wire or pasteboard, or heavily starched. The lace cuffs and collar also allowed the painter, Cornelis de Vos, to display his virtuosity in evoking transparency and spectacular effects of shortening.</p>

						<p>This small sculpture testifies to the association of lace with luxury fashion and the obsession with stiffness that characterizes research around textile materials. Starting in the 1880s, Dresden manufacturers started to produce porcelain lace figurines made following a technique invented a century earlier in the famous nearby porcelain center of Meissen. To create the illusion of real fabric, decorators would dip actual, delicate machine-made net lace into porcelain slip before applying it by hand to the porcelain figure. When fired in a kiln, the fabric would burn away, leaving a hard but extremely fragile shell of frozen crinoline skirts and billowy material behind. Buyers could therefore acquire at relatively low price these figurines where lace has acquired the stiffness of porcelain.</p>

						<p>This photograph by a student of Clarence H. White shows how the term lace can migrate to materials that are defined above all by their stiffness. Before taking on photography, Latimer worked as an engineer in the Taylor-Wharton Iron &amp; Steel Company and retained a long-term interest in suspended bridges. Here lace is defined by the pattern the steel cables form by intersecting on the open sky. It returns to the definition of lace as a material in which the pattern is surrounded by air, with bars of net holding the various elements of the pattern together. Here, soft material – linen, cotton, or silk – is replaced by iron and steel, opening the many possibilities we can think of for lace in architecture and design.</p>
