intro_text: The development of machine lace extended the use of lace in areas previously not systematically explored because of their scale.

Examples include curtains and wall decorations, where the size of the strands remained the same but the area that the textile can cover was greatly expanded. However, they remain confined to private, interior and domestic uses because of their inherent fragility. Scaling up and expanding the range of materials used to design lacing patterns can open to applications in the public and urban spaces. When prototyping robotics processes we often begin with a scale that fits the constraints of the available tools. To study robotically fabricated lace, we have dramatically increased the scale of the individual strand, as well as the spaces between the strands. Once again, this can change the way we interact with and experience a lace object, moving from the realm of surface into the interstitial.
