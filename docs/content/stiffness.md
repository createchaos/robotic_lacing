The use of lace in fashion is linked to the physical manipulation of the fiber material, which upon creation takes the form of its base, into something that can describe volumes distinct from the body. For example, a collar can be made stiff by starching and a ruff can become voluminous by ruching. While the former involves the addition of an external material, the latter speaks to the ability of a material to propel itself into the third dimension by the manipulation of its geometry. Painting lace objects, especially those made stiff by these processes, have been a stimulating challenge for painters, who could showcase their virtuosity in indicating both dramatic shortening and complex effects of transparency. The study of elasticity, which spans several centuries, reveals that a stiff material with a slender cross section will buckle out of plane as it seeks a minimal energy state. In engineering, such large deformations were studied in order to be prevented as they typically indicate structural failure. More recently there has been an abundance of interest in eliciting large elastic deformations for a wide range of applications in scales ranging from the nano to the architectural. Applied to lace, we consider the effects of working with inherently stiff yet pliant, elastic ribbons as opposed to formless round threads and witness the 3D forms that emerge.
