I")<p>This small sculpture testifies to the association of lace with luxury fashion and the obsession with stiffness that characterizes research around textile materials. Starting in the 1880s, Dresden manufacturers started to produce porcelain lace figurines made following a technique invented a century earlier in the famous nearby porcelain center of Meissen. To create the illusion of real fabric, decorators would dip actual, delicate machine-made net lace into porcelain slip before applying it by hand to the porcelain figure. When fired in a kiln, the fabric would burn away, leaving a hard but extremely fragile shell of frozen crinoline skirts and billowy material behind. Buyers could therefore acquire at relatively low price these figurines where lace has acquired the stiffness of porcelain.</p>
